\begin{abstract}
In \cite{Schmidt-2014}, the authors provide an overview of Heuristic-Driven
Theory Projection (HDTP), a logic-based computational model of analogical
reasoning. In this framework, an agent's knowledge of a familiar domain $S$ is
represented as a first-order theory, which can be projected into another, less
familiar domain $T$, by constructing a more general domain $G$, using
anti-unification of formulas \cite{Plotkin70}. 

To our knowledge, there has been so far no implementation of HDTP in a functional programming language. In the following report, we provide a functional algorithm in Haskell for reproducing many of the aspects of HDTP laid out in \cite{Schmidt-2014}.

\section{Analogical Reasoning and HDTP}
Analogical reasoning is a central aspect of human problem-solving skills
\cite{gentner}, creativity \cite{Besold2015GeneralizeAB}, and concept
formation \cite{hofstadter2013surfaces}, and as such, is a major focus of
research in cognitive science. Traditionally, analogical reasoning is defined to be the process in which an agent will attempt to understand an unfamiliar domain of knowledge $T$ (the \textit{target} domain) by noticing its similarity to a more familiar domain $S$ (the \textit{source} domain). This similarity allows an agent to propose novel hypotheses about the target domain, supposing that they have discovered a useful similarity between source and target.

The HDTP framework as laid out in \cite{Schmidt-2014}, approaches analogical reasoning from a syntactic point of view, representing domains of knowledge as first-order theories, and analogies as formal correspondences between formulae of those theories. 

HDTP sees the process of analogical reasoning as consisting of three phases: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Retrieval}, in which the source domain is formalized as a first-order theory;
    \item \textit{Mapping}, in which a formal correspondence is established between formulae in the source and target domains, by way of \textit{anti-unification};
    \item \textit{Transfer}, in which the correspondence established in the mapping phase is used to generate new formulae in the target domain, to serve as hypotheses in further reasoning.
\end{itemize} 

These three phases will guide our discussion of the current Haskell implementation over the course of the next three sections: Section 2 will provide details about how we have implemented first order theories, which will also serve to cover the retrieval phase of HDTP. Sections 3 and 4 will focus on the implementation of restricted higher-order anti-unification, which is the formal process at the heart of the mapping phase of HDTP. Section 5 will lay out how we have implemented a procedure for analogical transfer. Section 6 is an overview of the implementation of tests. In Section 7, we will summarize the achievements of the project so far, as well as what remains to be completed in further work.

\section{Testing the Algorithm}

Based on the examples in \cite{Schmidt-2014} we implemented test cases with \texttt{Hspec} for the basic substituations and the ntgg, alignment and transfer algorithms. The tests can be run with \verb|stack clean && stack test --coverage|. The code block below is an example for a test case of our ntgg algorithm.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We began this project because of our appreciation for what the authors of HDTP had been able to accomplish. We had hoped that by trying to translate some of their ideas into a functional programming context, we could learn more about HDTP in specific, and analogical reasoning more generally.

Like logic as a practice, the process of implementing an idea in code can be an excellent way to diagnose mistaken assumptions, flaws in reasoning, and fuzzy, ill-defined concepts. Our experience in trying to implement HDTP in Haskell was a perfect example of this. While the source material is an interesting analysis of analogical reasoning, the authors' attempt to formalize this often resulted in more confusion than clarity. As we've learned, translating something into formal language does not in and of itself guarantee the benefits of formal reasoning we described above.

Over the course of the project, we have had to fill in a number of conceptual holes which were not evident in the original papers. Conflations between terms and formulae, vagueness in the use of specific technical terms (like least general generalization), and a lack of proper specfication for some of the algorithms alluded to made the project more difficult than we expected. We did our best to remain true to the original work, while still settling issues where they arose.

We of course were limited as well in our implementation. For one, we have only tested our algorithm on examples from the original work, which may not present a full picture of either the successes or limitations of this model. In addition, time constraints prevented us from exploring more concrete design choices, such as in the definition of not too general generalizations, which remains vague.

In the end, with a bit of flexibility, we were happy to have created a Haskell program to see a system like HDTP in action. As well, we are proud to be pioneers in the application of Haskell to analogical reasoning. It is our hope that a program like ours might only be the beginning of more work on bringing HDTP into the broader computational and logical community.
